\section{Conclusion}

As shown in the beginning of this paper the CVE-2019-11510 is a vulnerability of high risk, as it compromise every protective goal. However, despite the potential danger of this vulnerability, the hypothesis of this paper is that in theory path traversal attacks can be avoided relatively easy, with the help of many different methods. But from this the question arises why path traversal attacks still occur. In order to make a qualified statement this topic should be examined in the course of another work.
